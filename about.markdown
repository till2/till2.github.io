I'm Till, 23 and finishing a MSc in Data Engineering. My passion projects are typically in the field of machine learning, deep learning and [reinforcement learning][why-rl]. This includes everything from deep neural network architectures, optimizers, training paradigms and from toy examples aimed at understanding a problem to larger scale projects. However I also enjoy exploring adjacent topics like psychology, statistics or data engineering. If you'd like to learn more, you can find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin] and view my projects on [GitHub][github].
