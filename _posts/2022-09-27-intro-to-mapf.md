## The Multi-Agent Pathfinding Problem

Multi-Agent Pathfinding (short: MAPF) is ...


## Assumptions

We assume that the environment is __discrete__ and __2-dimensional__, e.g. robots moving in a warehouse are modeled as points in a grid.
There probably are good algorithms for finding solutions in more complex scenarios, such as:

- 3d spaces
- continuous environments
- probabilistic environment dynamics

but we will stick to the easier problems in our MAPF course.
