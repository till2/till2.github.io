### Dataset

The transcribed subtitles for the first 325 episodes of the Lex Fridman Podcast are from [Andrej Karpathy's lexicap project][karpathy]. He in turn used the new [OpenAI whisper model][whisper] to transcribe them.
Let's look at one sample episode, ep.299 with Demis Hassabis.
The subtitles are stored in the video text track (vtt) format and look like this:

```c
00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
 The following is a conversation with Demis Hassabis,

00:03.480 --> 00:06.720
 CEO and co founder of DeepMind,

00:06.720 --> 00:08.600
 a company that has published and built

00:08.600 --> 00:12.200
 some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems

00:12.200 --> 00:14.120
 in the history of computing,

(...)
``` 

### Preprocessing

#### I) Speaker classification

My first idea was to train a speaker classification network that can distinguish between Lex and the guest to label each sentence, but as I didn't have much time to do that, we'll have to get around the problem that we don't know which sentence is spoken by whom for now.
The mel-spectogram for episode 299, which you could use to train a speaker classification net, looks like this:

<div class="img-block" style="width: 750px;">
    <img src="/images/chatbot/mel-spectogram.png"/>
</div>

#### II) Regular Expressions to clean up the VTT format

We don't want our model to generate timestamps and so on, so let's clean up the text a little bit.
We can do that via regular expressions, which gets us the following much nicer output.

<div class="output">
 The following is a conversation with Demis Hassabis,
 CEO and co founder of DeepMind,
 a company that has published and built
 some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems
 in the history of computing,
 including AlphaZero that learned all by itself
 to play the game of go better than any human in the world
 and AlphaFold2 that solved protein folding.
