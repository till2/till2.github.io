### The Multi-Agent Pathfinding Problem

Multi-Agent Pathfinding (__MAPF__) is the problem of planning paths for multiple agents without colliding.

### Applications

Currently, search-based MAPF solvers perform better than Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning applied to the MAPF problem in restrictive, discrete situations. State-of-the-art MAPF solvers can usually solve up to a low four digit number of agents. 
The classical application for these kinds of algorithms are logistic warehouses, so for now we might just be contributing ressources for free to Amazon. :/

### Assumptions

Common assumptions are:

- the environment is __discrete__
- an agent executes one action per timestep
- an agent occupies one vertex/node per timestep


### Input

The input to a MAPF problem is a triple <strong style="color: #1E72E7">$<G,s,t>$</strong> consisting of:

- an undirected graph <strong style="color: #1E72E7">$G = (V,E)$</strong>

- a mapping <strong style="color: #1E72E7">$s$</strong> to source vertices with 
<strong style="color: #1E72E7">$s: [1,\dots,k] \to V$</strong>

- a mapping <strong style="color: #1E72E7">$t$</strong> to target vertices with 
<strong style="color: #1E72E7">$t: [1,\dots,k] \to V$</strong>


### Solution

The solution of a MAPF problem is a set <strong style="color: #039947">$\pi$</strong> of single-agent plans without conflicts: 
<strong style="color: #039947">$\pi$ = {$\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots, \pi_k$}</strong> where $\pi_i$ denotes the single-agent plan for agent $i$. 
A single-agent plan is an action mapping $\pi$ (careful: notation overload!) that results in the agent being their target state. We can write this constraint as <strong style="color: #039947">$\pi_i[|\pi|] = t(i)$</strong>.

Note, that $\pi$ does __not__ include the starting position $s(i)$.
Instead, the first entry in $\pi$ is the action that performed on the first timestep.

We can also ask, where an agent $i$ is positioned after timestep $x$ (equivalent to asking which node an agent occupies). We would write this as <strong style="color: #039947">$\pi_i[x]$</strong>.


### Conflicts

To properly define a MAPF problem, you should cover which of the following conflicts are allowed and which can not appear in a solution $\pi$.

__Conflict types__:

![][conflicts-img]

a) Vertex conflict
b) Swapping conflict
c) Following conflict
d) Circle conflict

### Objectives and Constraints

The two most used objective functions are the __Makespan__ and __Sum of costs__.

#### Makespan

The __Makespan__ of a MAPF solution is definded as the number of timesteps it takes until all agents reach their goals:
<strong style="color: #d98404" >$J(\pi) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq k}|\pi_i|$</strong>

#### Sum of costs

The __sum of costs__ objective function takes the length of all individual agent plans into consideration by summing over all action plan lengths: <strong style="color: #d98404" >$J(\pi) = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k}|\pi_i|$</strong>

There is also the not so common __sum of fuel__ objective function that counts all non-waiting moves.

An __optimal solution__ to our problem is one that __minimizes the chosen objective function__ <strong style="color: #d98404" >$J(\pi)$</strong> (and satisfies all other given constraints).

#### Constraints

Typical hard constraints that are additionally added are __k-robustness__ (an agent can only move to a vertex that hasn't been visited by any agent for $k$ timesteps) and __formation rules__.
The __k-robustness__ adresses the possiblity of delays that could result in agents colliding at execution. The goal is to be within a probabilistic margin for conflicts or have a policy that can deal with delays at execution time to prevent conflicts.
__Formation rules__ enforce a specific formation of agents, e.g. to allow communication chains via neighboring agents.

### Target behaviors

If an agent that already arrived at its target position doesn't plan on moving away from the target while waiting for other agents to reach their goals it is common to not count the waiting moves towards the sum of cost. 

There are two possibilities of handling agents that reach their target. The agent can either __stay at the target__ or __disappear at the target__. The stay at target behavior is more commonly used because it doesn't assume that the environment has a special mechanism for handling the transportation of the agent (e.g. to a fixed starting position) upon arriving at the target.


### Special MAPF problems

#### Weighted Actions

MAPF with weighted actions addresses problems, where the assumption of one action per timestep is not useful. The length of an action can be encoded as the weights in an weighted graph, which can be represented as $2^k$-grids or in a generalized form as euclidian (2d) space.
Note, that diagonal moves in euclidian space are possible and have an execution (time-) cost of $\sqrt{2}$.

#### Motion-planning

This takes the MAPF problem to a __state-based__ problem, where the state encodes information like position, orientation and velocity. AN edge between two state configurations can be seen as planning movement (or kinematic motion). If kinematic constraints are added to the MAPF problem, the graph becomes __directed__.

A (not comprehensive) list of other extensions of MAPF includes

- MAPF with large agents
- MAPF with kinematic constraints
- Anonymous MAPF
- Colored MAPF
- Online-MAPF.


### Aspirilo

Aspirilo is a simulator (and visualizer) that includes support for movement-only warehouse setting, which correspond to the multi-agent path finding problem.

### Visualizer Installation

Install the [visualizer](https://asprilo.github.io/visualizer/) via:
```bash
conda install asprilo-visualizer -c potassco -c potassco/label/dev.
```

Then you can simply run it using viz:

```bash
viz -t <instance.lp>
```

Or save a plan as a file using these steps:

1. Solve the reified test_instance.lp with our meta-telingo
2. Only capture the `occurs`-atoms using the regular expression `occurs\(.*\)`
3. Pipe the `occurs`-atoms in a `test_plan.lp` file using the `tee` command that pipes them into the file and prints the atoms
4. Run the viz using the `test_instance.lp` and `test_plan.lp` files

This command will first use grep to search for all occurrences of the regular expression for the `occurs` atom in the file "input_file.txt" as before. The output of grep command is piped into sed command which replaces the blank space after each occurs atom with a period. The output of the sed command is then piped into yet another command - tee - which writes the output to both the terminal and the specified file "test_plan.lp". Then we use echo to add a last period after the last occurs atom because it didn't have a blank space to be replaced after it. 

The resulting plan is a valid input for the aspirilo visualizer. We save this plan as `test_plan.lp` to call the aspirilo visualizer and use it together with the corresponding instance.

```bash
clingo encoding.lp test_instance.lp --output=reify | clingo - meta-telingo.lp output-meta-telingo.lp -c horizon=9 | grep -o "occurs\(.*\)" | sed 's/ /\./g' | tee test_plan.lp; echo . >> test_plan.lp

viz -l test_instance.lp test_plan.lp
```


### Introduction

Go to:
```bash
/home/till/Desktop/GitHub/telingo-wise22-23-themetaprogrammers/aspirilo-meta-telingo
```

Great, we got a model! I believe that only the `occurs(object(robot,1),action(move,(1,0)),2)` atoms are part of the solution. This example atom says that robot1 moved 1 cell up in timestep 2. The rest of the atoms are all part of the initialization of the instance.

Now we can try to break everything by converting it to meta-telingo :D


To solve an instance with our `meta-telingo.lp` program, you need to first reify `encoding.lp` (which includes `action-M.lp`, a goal-test `goal-M.lp` and an output conversion file `output-M.lp`) and the instance, in our case `test_instance.lp`. We also automatically include `input.lp` in the `action-M.lp` file. Then you pipe the reified facts into `meta-telingo.lp` to solve it using clingo, in this case using `horizon=15` and showing the first model by setting the number of models parameter to `1`.
```bash
clingo encoding.lp test_instance.lp --output=reify | clingo - meta-telingo.lp -c horizon=15 1
```

_For the KRR project, we will restrict ourselves to the movement only (`M`) domain._


### Action-M.lp encoding

- rewrite with `prev()` operators instead of `T-1`
- add `#external` commands with all atoms that are possible for this atom included on the right hand side to avoid unsafe atmoms, e.g. `#external move(R,C) :- robot(R), vertex(C)` (maybe instead of `:-` only write `:`, try both and test which one works. Also look in the files from the beginning of the semester to see how we did it there.)

#### Include the input encoding

For the `input.lp` encoding, we'll have to change the path since it's in the same directory: 
```c
#include "./input.lp".
```

#### Position/3

The robot `R` is at cell `C`, which is a tuple with the coordinates (X,Y), at time step `T`. 

```c
position(R,C,T) :- move(R,D,T), position(R,C',T-1),     nextto(C',D,C).
                :- move(R,D,T), position(R,C ,T-1), not nextto(C ,D,_).
```

We'll now modify all of the code in `action.lp` to use `prev(atom(T))` instead of `atom(T-1)`.
For the previous code block, this is the result:

```c
position(R,C,T) :- move(R,D,T), prev(position(R,C',T)),     nextto(C',D,C).
                :- move(R,D,T), prev(position(R,C ,T)), not nextto(C ,D,_).
```

#### Externals

Now that we have included some meta-telingo _prev_ operators, we'll have to tell clingo to not delete them in preprocessing by using `#external`.

```c
%*
externals
*%
aux_cell(C) :- nextto(C,_,_).
aux_cell(C) :- position(_,C,_).

#external prev(position(R,C,T)) : robot(R), aux_cell(C), time(T).
#external initially.
#external finally.
#external horizon.
```

Here is the program with all the discussed changes so far:
```lp
#include "./input.lp".

#const horizon=15.
time(1..horizon).

direction((X,Y)) :- X=-1..1, Y=-1..1, |X+Y|=1.
nextto((X,Y),(X',Y'),(X+X',Y+Y')) :- position((X,Y)), direction((X',Y')), position((X+X',Y+Y')).

{ move(R,D,T) : direction(D) } 1 :- isRobot(R), time(T).

% - move/3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
position(R,C,T) :- move(R,D,T), prev(position(R,C',T)),     nextto(C',D,C).
                :- move(R,D,T), prev(position(R,C ,T)), not nextto(C ,D,_).

% - inertia ---------------------------------------------------------------------
position(R,C,T) :- prev(position(R,C,T)), not move(R,_,T), isRobot(R), time(T).

% - edge collision --------------------------------------------------------------
moveto(C',C,T) :- nextto(C',D,C), prev(position(R,C',T)), move(R,D,T).
:- moveto(C',C,T), moveto(C,C',T), C < C'.

% - vertex collision ------------------------------------------------------------
:- { position(R,C,T) : isRobot(R) }  > 1, position(C), time(T).

% - auxiliaries -----------------------------------------------------------------
:- { position(R,C,T) } != 1, isRobot(R), time(T).    % REDUNDANT but PERFORMANT?

%*
externals
*%
aux_cell(C) :- nextto(C,_,_).
aux_cell(C) :- position(_,C,_).

#external prev(position(R,C,T)) : robot(R), aux_cell(C), time(T).
#external initially.
#external finally.
```

Let's try to run it.

```bash
clingo encoding.lp test_instance.lp --output=reify | clingo - meta-telingo.lp -c horizon=15 1
```

<div class="output">
clingo version 5.4.1 <br>
Reading from - ... <br>
Solving... <br>
UNSATISFIABLE <br>
 <br>
Models       : 0 <br>

CPU Time     : 11.616s <br>
</div>

This should have been satisfiable, so we are not finished yet. Let's try to remove the timestep atoms.


#### Time

Now comes the hardest step: We will have to remove all timesteps `T` from the code since the time is already being handled in `meta-telingo.lp`.


The `goal-M.lp` file before removing the timesteps:

```c
processed(A,R) :- ordered(O,A), shelved(S,A), isRobot(R), position(S,C,0),
                  position(R,C,horizon).
processed(A)   :- processed(A,R).

:- ordered(O,A), not processed(A).
```

The `output-M.lp` file before removing the timesteps:

```c
#show.
#show init/2.

#show occurs(object(robot,R), action(move,D),     T) :    move(robot(R),D,T).
```

The old `input.lp` file before removing timesteps: 

```c
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% REPRESENTATION

robot(R)                     :- init(object(robot,R),          _).
shelf(S)                     :- init(object(shelf,S),          _).
station(P)                   :- init(object(pickingStation,P), _).
product(A)                   :- init(object(product,A),        _).

    isRobot(robot(R)) :- robot(R).
    isShelf(shelf(S)) :- shelf(S).
isStation(station(T)) :- station(T).
isProduct(product(A)) :- product(A).
    isOrder(order(O)) :- order(O).

  order(      O            ) :- init(object(order,O),          _).
ordered(order(O),product(A)) :- init(object(order,O),          value(line,(A,_))).      % IGNORING QUANTITIES
 target(order(O),station(P)) :- init(object(order,O),          value(pickingStation,P)).

shelved(shelf(S),product(A)) :- init(object(product,A),        value(on,(S,_))).        % IGNORING QUANTITIES

position(           (X,Y))   :- init(object(node,_),           value(at,(X,Y))).

position(station(P),(X,Y))   :- init(object(pickingStation,P), value(at,(X,Y))).

position(  robot(R),(X,Y),0) :- init(object(robot,R),          value(at,(X,Y))).
position(  shelf(S),(X,Y),0) :- init(object(shelf,S),          value(at,(X,Y))).

highway(            C    )   :- init(object(highway,_),        value(at,C)).
```
