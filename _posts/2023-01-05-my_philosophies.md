### Introduction

This post is a collection of thoughts and guidelines that I believe could be valueable to someone reading this, so I chose to publish it even though it took some internal convincing. Feel free to ask questions and/ or discuss the content.

### Be a producer rather than a consumer - it's way more fulfilling

Being a producer (build things!) rather than a consumer can definitely be way more fulfilling, as it allows you to create and contribute value to the world around you, you can feel proud about the things you build and it's a great way to learn new things (project-based learning). You can also make a positive impact on others, grow in the process and produce something new or cool. You also have a sense of control from being a creator, rather than just consuming anything that comes your way. Then, it gives you the opportunity to express yourself and expore your creativity. Lastly, you also gain a deeper understanding of the world and gather valuable datapoints of how difficult and rewarding different things are. I once again quote Feynman: <q>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</q>


### The specialist's gambit

- add an explanation
- PICTURE

### Ego

- understanding ego is super important
- if you understand ego, you can take measures to reduce it
-> it's important that you do stuff because of the right reasons (otherwise it's not fulfilling, might be harmful, etc.)

Ego is often misunderstood as self-importance. I think of it as a comparison to others, but it can go both ways (you can feel less worthy/ worse or better than others).

I find that I have a relatively strong ego and am pretty competitive. But through introspection, I try to reduce it.

- nature is a great way to reduce ego (it naturally decays because you have no one to compare yourself to - you might have leftover thoughts that come up, but nature won't be the source of ego, so spending more time in nature naturally reduces ego)

- you learn less if you feel like you already know more

Recognizing and managing our ego can help us become more self-aware, humble, and compassionate. It can also help us make decisions that are more aligned with our values and goals. Acting ego-driven can distort our perceptions and judgment, leading us to make choices that are not in our best interests or that harm others. There are a variety of techniques that can help us reduce our ego, such as mindfulness practices, grounding, and self-compassion.

Unfortunately, if you do good in the field of AI/RL, it bloats your Ego. As a compensation i am proposing to get interested into Astronomy that humbles and theirby reduces your Ego.

I think that AGI will lead to a lot of greed. 
Hopefully it also makes us realize that we are pretty stupid if you look at it in a bigger frame. Hopefully we accept being stupid and exercise some humility.


### Meditation

- meditation is a great tool for introspection (examining how you function -> understanding yourself) and also has the nice side effect of improving mental health
- it can be used to balance emotions, thoughts, ego, ...

- [Dr. Alok Kanojia - How Ego Controls us and How to Control Ego ](https://youtu.be/cHFD2ycNsBs)


### Building relationships

- give dense reward to learn, adapt & grow faster (tell if you didn't like something, or if something was nice)
- work on problems together, be able to learn and adapt
- respect


### How to succeed

- Learn in dense reward settings like writing open-source code, where you get lots of feedback on the code you write
-> much quicker learning 
- try to be the dumbest person in the room and learn from others
- teaching and writing can be great tools for organizing your thoughts and ideas
- have a bias towards action: You made a great plan. Now go and do it.
- explore a lot until you find ideas, projects and people that are work pursuing
- have a group of like-minded people around you for practicing consistency
- encourage sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, openness, equality (no order-structures) --rewrite, exploration (googles 80/20 (?) rule)
- teams can achieve more


### Work

- don't pick your field because of ego (money, fame, feeling better than others), pick it because of a deep curiosity

- for me it's important to know that I'm working on something important (otherwise I wouldn't have the drive to work as hard as I do)
- for me: if you crack learning, you win at everything (ABBA: The winner takes it all)
- I believe that many people (doesn't matter if they work hard or not) work on the wrong things -> I try to be really thoughtful about what goal I am working towards/ what field, company, ... I am working in (should be fulfilling, have long-term potential, be hard so others can't replicate it easily, if it's on the edge of just barely being possible that's great, ...)


### Find balance

- for me, i balance hard work with:

- loud music
- meditation
- creative things (music, drawing, coding, ...)
- walks in nature


### Do hard things

- be able endure pain and get no reward (long-term focus) for prolonged periods
- Rolltreppen-Beispiel (nur wenn ich alleine bin) :)

### Learning

- seek understanding
- project-based learning
- diene Vorurteile erkennen (vorurteile hindern lernen) - sie gezielt exploren
- ask questions (people who ask lots of questions in uni are usually the ones that do well, it gives you the ability to make sure you understand everything and also motivates to prepare better etc.)
Bsp Informatik - Applied math, Lots of beauty
- listen to understand not to respond (common mistake. I notice this so often.. people just listen to respond and don't ACTUALLY listen to understand)


### Teaching

Intuition is the most omprtant thing for Research. Do you think only because a child can multiply big Numbers togeeht in their head fast, rhats a sifn of Genius?
You shouldnt teach how it works straight away,  it's mucj more importatant to understand why it works First.


### Learn from first principles

Start from learning First principles - often skipped bc of Ego (this is top easy for me, let me look at harder stuff) -- but often Progress this Attitude keeps you from making Progress and you get Stuck in the holes that you dug yourdeld by Not building a good Fundament.


### Follow anti-hype

- hype brings a huge amount of variance (stupidity and stacking of sources - people learn from people who don't really know how it works, which in return learned from people who also don't really understand it, etc. - you should try to learn ideas directly from the source)
- for me, hype gives me headache (I can't think clearly, it's more of a foggy, very primitive feeling) and I try to avoid it (also money often correlates with hype, that's unfortunate sometimes - try to work with smart people who can deal with money)
- hype leads to the promotion of interesting or emotional ideas, not ideas that are true
- if you notice that you are greedy, you messed up big time

### Ask big questions

- ask big questions and tacke big/ hard problems - that's how you attract talent if you are a company (deepmind, spacex, tesla, comma, ...) 
- ask big questions even if they might make you look stupid, like searching for alien life (like Carl Sagan) - otherwise we won't discover new things and learn and understand as much


### Appreciate small things

My favorite quote:
<q>Beautiful things don't ask for attention.</q>
(Walter Mitty clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMqcgkoQARU)


### Organize your thoughts

- through writing and teaching

### Examine how you work
- how you repond to Coffee, how much sleep you Neef, in whicj timeperiods you are most produktive, ...
- if you do this, you can exploit that knowledge later (and when it matters) to optimize stuff


### Dopamine

- hypothesis: more variance -> more learning needed -> higher acc. dopamine release (maybe correlated to addiction)
-> example: social media has a very high variance for quality, factuality, fun, emotions, ... 

- try to consume long form content (movies and books) to reduce your dopamine baseline and theirfore make other activities more rewarding
