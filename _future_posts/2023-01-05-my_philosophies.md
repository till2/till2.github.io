### Introduction

This post is a collection of thoughts and guidelines that I believe could be valueable to someone reading this, so I chose to publish it even though it took some internal convincing. Feel free to ask questions and/ or discuss the content.

### Be a producer rather than a consumer - it's way more fulfilling

Being a producer (build things!) rather than a consumer can definitely be way more fulfilling, as it allows you to create and contribute value to the world around you, you can feel proud about the things you build and it's a great way to learn new things (project-based learning). You can also make a positive impact on others, grow in the process and produce something new or cool. You also have a sense of control from being a creator, rather than just consuming anything that comes your way. Then, it gives you the opportunity to express yourself and expore your creativity. Lastly, you also gain a deeper understanding of the world and gather valuable datapoints of how difficult and rewarding different things are. Quoting Richard Feynman:

### The specialist's gambit

### Meditation

Meditation is a great tool for introspection (examining how you function and understanding yourself) and has the added benefit of improving mental health. It can be used to balance emotions, thoughts, ego, and more. Dr. Alok Kanojia's videos on ["What is Ego"](https://youtu.be/ozu9Jd_Fm-I) and on ["How Ego Controls us and How to Control Ego"](https://youtu.be/cHFD2ycNsBs) are in my opinion both excellent resources for learning more about the concept of ego and how meditation can help manage it.


### Ego

Ego is often misunderstood as self-importance, but I think of it as a comparitave measure that measures some feature of you compared to others. Understanding ego is extremely important because if you do things for egotistical reasons, they are probably not going be fulfilling and could potentially cause harm. Now if you understand ego, you can take measures to reduce it, which I think will make you a better person.

By saying ego doesn't measure self-importance, I mean that ego is a measure that can go both ways: you can feel either less worthy or more worthy than others in a particular aspect of your life. I have a relatively strong ego and am quite competitive, but through introspection, I often try to reduce it. I notice that the ego arises for example when I finish yet another cool project while many others have spend their time on social media or in other low-value environments, which makes me a little sad (so much wasted potential!).

One way to reduce your ego is by spending more time in nature, where you have no one to compare yourself to. As you might imagine, there are various other techniques that can help us reduce our ego, such as mindfulness practices, grounding (i.e. through yoga), and self-compassion (which you could also include under the term meditation).

Doing this has many upsides: You'll be more likely to explore new things, whereas with a higher ego you wouldn't, because when learning a new skill, you'll have to start somewhere - and that is at the bottom, meaning, that many others will be better at that thing than you when you first start. Now if you have a strong ego, that might hurt it/ discourage you from trying this new thing. In much the same way, i believe that you'll be more likely to learn from others, make decisions that are more aligned with your values, become more self-aware, humble, and compassionate. 

As a last note, you can also think about how your particular field might affect your ego if that is important. For example, the field of Artificial Intelligence and Reinfocement Learning yields so many cool projects and ideas, that it might very well bloat your ego. As a compensation, I like to also spend some time in fields that are very humbling, such as Astronomy. 

I believe that the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will lead to a lot of greed. Hopefully, it will also make us realize that we are rather ignorant/ stupid when we consider a larger frame of reference. Right now, it's fair game to think that humans are the smartest species on earth, but when AGI proviedes some scale on how much smarter an intelligent system can get, I think that might be a very well deserved and humbling hit that we'll have to accept.


### Building relationships

When building relationships, it's important to give dense rewards (by that I mean frequent feedback) to learn, adapt, and grow faster. This means being open and honest in your communication, letting others know if you didn't like something or if something didn't work for you. It's also important to be open to receiving feedback and criticism, as it can help you improve and grow. Additionally, try to be a good listener and make an effort to understand where others are coming from. Building strong relationships requires a lot of effort and time, but it is very well worth it.


### How to succeed

It's not for everybody, but if you want to put in a lot of effort and really succeed with your plan of action, here are my tips. 
One key to success is learning in dense reward settings, such as writing open-source code, where you get a lot of feedback on the code you write. This can lead to much quicker learning compared to settings where there exists a lot of variance. Another tip is to try to always be the dumbest person in the room and learn from others while you are on your learning journey (of course this will only be possible while there exist people with more knowledge than you have in that area, but if they don't exist, you have already reached the top and thus succeeded). Teaching and writing can also be great tools for organizing your thoughts and ideas. It's important to have a bias towards action, meaning that once you have made a great plan, you should go and do it. Exploration is also crucial, as it helps you find ideas, projects, and people that are worth pursuing. Surround yourself with a group of like-minded people for the sake of consistency, and encourage sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, openness, and equality (no order structures). Teams can often achieve more than individuals, so consider working with others to accomplish your goals.


### Work

When choosing a field to work in, it's important not to be motivated by ego (such as the desire for more money, fame, or feeling better than others). Instead, pick a field out of deep curiosity. For me, it's important to know that I'm working on something important, as this gives me the drive to work hard. I believe that cracking the learning problem will be a great leap forward in our history, that's why I chose this field. I also believe that many people (regardless of how hard they work) are working on the wrong things (that don't really benefit anyone or achieve much). That's why I try to be thoughtful about the goals I am working towards and the field, company, etc. that I am working in. It should be fulfilling, have long-term potential, be challenging so that others can't easily replicate it, and ideally be on the edge of just barely being possible. Lastly, it's important to find a balance between work and other aspects of your life, and to find work that aligns with your values and goals. Also having a positive and supportive work environment is nice.


### Find some balance

Finding balance in life can be challenging, but it's important for overall well-being and happiness. I balance hard work with activities such as listening to a lot of music, meditating, engaging in creative pursuits like drawing and coding, and taking walks in nature. It's also important to practice some self-care to maintain your physical and mental health and setting aside time for hobbies, exercise, or quality time with loved ones.


### Do hard things

One key to success is the ability to endure pain and work without immediate reward (long-term focus) for prolonged periods of time. This requires discipline, determination, and a strong sense of purpose. It's easy to get discouraged, but the rewards of perseverance are worth it. By challenging yourself and pushing your limits, you can grow and achieve things that you never thought possible. So don't be afraid to do hard things. 

Sidenote: <em>When I'm alone I always take the stairs in favor of the escalators to remind myself of doing hard things.</em> This sidenote seems really random, and let me assure you it is, but I didn't want to hide a personal thingy that I've got going in a post about philosophy, which is a personal topic.


### Learning

Learning is a vital part of life. To truly learn and understand something, i'd say it's important to seek understanding and engage in project-based learning (with project-based learning I am refering to just doing a lot of hobby projects in the areas that you are learning about). For me, and many others I know, this is much more effective than learning methods. Another key aspect of learning is to recognize and explore your own biases, as they can hinder your learning. Asking questions is also crucial, as it helps you ensure that you fully understand the material and can motivate you to prepare better. It's also important to listen to understand, rather than just to respond. This is a common mistake that many people make, but it's crucial to actively listen and try to truly understand what others are saying. This is a skill that you can practice and improve on.


### Teaching

Teaching is a valuable skill that can help you better understand and retain information. When you teach something to someone else, it forces you to thoroughly understand the material and to find ways to explain it in a clear and concise manner. It's also a great way to organize your thoughts and ideas, and to identify any gaps in your understanding. By teaching others, you can also help them learn and grow, which can be a rewarding experience.


### Learn from first principles

One effective approach to learning is to start by understanding first principles. This can be tempting to skip, especially if you have a strong ego and believe that the material is too easy for you. However, this attitude can actually hinder your progress and keep you from making progress. It's important to build a solid foundation by understanding the basic principles, as this will help you avoid getting stuck in the holes later that you dug for yourself by skipping fundamentals. By starting with first principles, you can develop a deeper understanding of the material and be better prepared to tackle more advanced topics. So don't be afraid to take the time to understand grasp the most atomic parts of a subject – it will pay off in the long run.


### Be careful of hype

It's important to be mindful of hype, as it can bring a huge amount of variance and even stupidity. This is because people often learn from sources that don't really understand the material, leading to a stacking of incorrect information. To avoid this, try to learn ideas directly from the source. Hype can also be overwhelming and lead to a foggy, primitive feeling, so it's important to take a step back and try to think clearly. Additionally, money often correlates with hype, which can be unfortunate, because it is a necessary ressource for large, valuable projects. Try to work with smart people who can handle money in a responsible way. Hype promotes interesting or emotional ideas, not necessarily ideas that are true. It also has a bias towards promoting ideas that are simple to explain, so naturally great ideas and fundamental work isn't be surrounded by hype (because it's hard to explain and thus the ideas don't spread that easily). Even if a great idea gets hyped up, it's usually only the applied projects and not the real fundamental progress that gets the mass attention. 

I want to add that if you find yourself becoming greedy, it's a sign that you need to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities. I've noticed that the building often happens in times of abundance of hype, such as ['crypto winters'](https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-winter-5496605) as an example from the field of cryptocurrencies.


### Ask big questions

Asking big questions and tackling big, hard problems is a key to success and attracting talent, as demonstrated by companies such as DeepMind, SpaceX, Tesla, and Comma. It's important to ask big questions, even if they might make you look stupid, because it's through these kinds of inquiries that we make new discoveries and learn and understand more about the world around us. As Carl Sagan once said, "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." So don't be afraid to ask big questions and explore the unknown – it's through this kind of curiosity and bold thinking that we as a species make meaningful progress and contributions. As a comment to why I'm thinking in these big terms, such as 'as a species', I'd like to add that we in our lifetime have a reasonably good change of visiting other planets (Mars), understanding a lot about intelligence, solving many fundamental problems with it, so I think now is the time to think big. 


### Appreciate small things

One of my favorite quotes is ["Beautiful things don't ask for attention."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMqcgkoQARU) It emphasises that the small, subtle things in life are often the most beautiful and worth appreciating. It's easy to get caught up in daily life and overlook the small things that bring us joy, but taking the time to appreciate these things can bring a lot of fulfillment and happiness.


### Organize your thoughts

Writing and teaching are powerful tools for organizing your thoughts and ideas. When you write, you are forced to think critically and clearly articulate your ideas, which can help you better understand and retain information. Teaching others also requires a thorough understanding of the material and the ability to explain it in a way that others can understand. By teaching, you can also identify any gaps in your understanding and find ways to clarify and organize your thoughts. Additionally, both writing and teaching allow you to reflect on your own knowledge and understanding, which can help you identify areas for improvement and further learning.


### Examine how you work

It's important to take the time to examine how you work, as it can help you optimize your productivity and effectiveness. For example, consider how you respond to coffee, how much sleep you need, and during which time periods you are most productive. By understanding these factors, you can exploit this knowledge later on to optimize your work and make the most of your time and energy. Additionally, it can help you identify any potential challenges or areas for improvement, and motivates you to find strategies to improve. Generally, paying attention to how you work pays off in the long run and helps you be more efficient and successful.


### Dopamine

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in reward-driven learning. My hypothesis is that higher variance in stimuli overall leads to more learning (because you need to learn a lot in both directions until you converge). The high variance results in slower convergence on a good policy and world-model, which in turn leads to a higher sum of released dopamine. This may also be correlated with addiction. For example, social media platforms often have a high variance in terms of quality, factuality, fun, and emotions, which can lead to higher dopamine release. Try to consume long form content (movies and books) to reduce your dopamine baseline and thus make other activities more rewarding.
