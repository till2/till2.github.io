title: Markov decision process

Hello, traveler! <br>
This site acts as a [markov decision process (MDP),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) for human agents to pick posts and collect rewards in a typical RL setting. Can you figure out what the optimal policy is?
Hint: You might want to explore the site first and then commit to an answer.

Afterwards, you can check the optimal policy and value functions for this site here. <!-- maybe add links for "here" -->
